Git workflow practice

Type git status in your terminal. In the output, notice that your README.md file is shown in red, which means that this file is not staged. 

Type git add README.md. This command adds your README.md file to the staging area in Git. Now, type git status again. In the output, notice that your file is now shown in green, which means that this file is now in the staging area. 

Type git commit -m "Add README.md" and then type git status once more. The output should now say, “nothing to commit”, indicating that your changes have been committed. 

Type git log and look at the output. You should see an entry for your “Add README.md” commit. You will also see details on the author who made the commit and the date and time for when the commit was made.
